## Overview

This toolbox is used for creating, running, and analyzing "bubble" noise 
listening tests.  The goal of this procedure is to identify the importance 
of each time-frequency point in the spectrogram of an utterance to its 
intelligibility in noise.  To do this, the toolbox creates many mixtures of
the same utterances with different instances of "bubble" noise.  The 
analysis then identifies TF points where the noise is correlated with the 
intelligibility of the mixture (called time frequency importance functions 
(TFIFs) or time-frequency cross tabulation images (TFCTs)).  The toolbox 
will also run a predictive analysis on the mixtures, using cross-validation 
to train a classifier to predict whether mixtures of each original clean 
utterance were intelligible to listeners and then measure its prediction 
accuracy on held out test data.

This toolbox depends on the [mimlib toolbox](https://github.com/mim/mimlib)
for certain required supporting functions, so please download that as well.

## Setup and tuning

```matlab
% Shared parameters
wavInDir = 'D:\input\cleanUtterances';
mixOutDir = 'D:\mixes\dev';
noiseRefFile = 'D:\input\noiseRef.wav';
dur_s = 1.8;
normalize = 1;
baseSnr_db = -35;

% Make noise reference file
combineWavsIntoNoiseRef(wavInDir, noiseRefFile);

% Clean files for reference (correct scaling, etc)
nMixes = 1;
bubblesPerSecond = inf;
mixMrtBubbleNoiseDir(wavInDir, mixOutDir, nMixes, bubblesPerSecond, baseSnr_db, dur_s, normalize, noiseRefFile);

% Mixes with no bubbles
% make sure baseSnr_db is set so that these are completely unintelligible
nMixes = 5;
bubblesPerSecond = 0;
mixMrtBubbleNoiseDir(wavInDir, mixOutDir, nMixes, bubblesPerSecond, baseSnr_db, dur_s, normalize, noiseRefFile);
```

## Run adaptive experiment

```matlab
nMixes = 5;
initialBps = 15;        % whatever you want
subjectName = 'TLA';    % whatever you want
playAdaptiveListening(wavInDir, mixOutDir, subjectName, nMixes, initialBps, dur_s, baseSnr_db, noiseRefFile, normalize, 1, 0);
% wavs saved in mixOutDir/bps[subjectName]
% data file saved in mixOutDir, named subjectName_timestamp.csv
```

## OR Run non-adaptive experiment

```matlab
% Actual bubbles files, experiment with different bubbles-per-seconds values until 
% subjects get 50% correct. When you've found that, use at least 200 mixtures per 
% utterance (nMixes)
nMixes = 5;
bubblesPerSecond = 12;
mixDir = mixMrtBubbleNoiseDir(wavInDir, mixOutDir, nMixes, bubblesPerSecond, baseSnr_db, dur_s, normalize, noiseRefFile);

% Run experiment
subjectName = 'TLA';    % whatever you want
playListeningTestDir(mixDir, subjectName)
% file saved in mixDir, named subjectName_timestamp.csv
```


## Analysis

```matlab
% Massage and combine listening test data from multiple tests
inCsvFiles = fullfile(mixDir, 'TLA_20140621T114000.csv');  % Can be a cell array of multiple csv files
resultFile = 'D:\mixes\dev\results1.mat';
verbose = 1;
ignoreStimulusDir = 1;
processListeningData(inCsvFiles, resultFile, verbose, ignoreStimulusDir);

% Extract features from mixtures
baseFeatDir = 'D:\mixes\dev\features';
pattern = 'bps.*.wav';
pcaDims = [100 1000];  % 100 dimensions from 1000 files
usePcaDims = 40;
trimFrames = 0;
overwrite = 0;
win_s = 0.064;         % analysis FFT window size in seconds
setLength_s = 0;
maxFreq_hz = 10000;
mainBubbleAnalysis(mixDir, resultFile, baseFeatDir, pattern, noiseRefFile, pcaDims, usePcaDims, trimFrames, win_s, overwrite, setLength_s, maxFreq_hz)
```
